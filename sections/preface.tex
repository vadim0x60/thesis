First and foremost, I am lucky to be supervised by Aki Harma and Milan Petkovic, who, in addition to their vast technical experience and managerial skills, including keeping a straight face when listening to my ideas (and time estimates), took care of grant writing, consortium meetings, financial planning and other unglamorous aspects of the work.
The role of supervisors, in my experience, can be best illustrated by figure \ref{fig:soldiers-meme}.

I would like to acknowledge Lut van Kollenburg and Staff Immigration Team at the Eindhoven University of Technology for supporting me through several rare edge cases of immigration law at a time when I would strongly prefer not to be deported to Russia. 

Finally, I cannot thank my friends, family and love ones\footnote{these sets have considerable intersections} enough for stoically bearing the brunt of the mental health impact of writing this thesis.

\section{Objective}

Everything in the following chapters serves the main research goal of this thesis, which is:

\begin{highlight}
    develop program induction technology for health services based on deep learning
\end{highlight}

\section{Outline}

Chapter \ref{ch:promise} explains the background and motivation behind the research project: what is deep program induction and why is it a promising approach in safety-critical fields like healthcare. Chapter \ref{ch:proposal} proposes and motivates a reference architecture for harnessing the power of deep program induction in the field of healthcare: \emph{Patient Simulator Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning} (PatientSPIRL).

PatientSPIRL requires 2 ingredients: a patient simulator and an algorithm for Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning.
We review the research literature in both areas (chapters \ref{ch:methods} and \ref{ch:simulators-sota}), and argue that the current state of the art in each is inadequate to make PatientSPIRL a reality.
In parts \ref{part:proginduction} and \ref{part:simulators} we address this and make novel contributions to PIRL and patient simulators respectively.

Part \ref{part:proginduction} is dedicated to program induction methodology.
Chapter \ref{ch:methods} reviews the state of the art and identifies gaps of particular importance to PatientSPIRL, particularly the nascent state of \emph{Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning} (PIRL).
Chapters \ref{ch:bfpp}, \ref{ch:neurogen}, \ref{ch:tree2tree}, \ref{ch:iterative} and \ref{ch:seidr} propose, evaluate and compare different techniques to address these gaps.
Chapter \ref{ch:bfpp} proposes \emph{BF++}, a novel domain-specific language specifically for PIRL settings and evaluates an LSTM-based BF++ program synthesis model on standard Gymnasium \cite{towersGymnasiumStandardInterface2024} benchmarks.
Chapter \ref{ch:neurogen} improves upon the results of chapter \ref{ch:bfpp} by combining the strength of the LSTM and genetic programming techniques, a hybrid methodology we refer to as \emph{neurogenetic programming}.
Chapter \ref{ch:tree2tree} explores an evaluates an alternative approach: training a tree-based autoencoder model for \emph{autoencoder genetic programming} on competitive programming data.
Finally, chapters \ref{ch:iterative} and \ref{ch:seidr} explore Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models: chapter \ref{ch:iterative} argues that the key to successful application of LLMs in program induction is an iterative process of program improvement and demonstrates this in BOPTEST building optimization benchmark, while chapter \ref{ch:seidr} takes an empirical approach to selecting the optimal iterative program induction algorithm with a comprehensive matrix of experiments comparing different resolutions of the \emph{repair-replace tradeoff} on PSB2 and HumanEval datasets.

Part \ref{part:simulators} is dedicated to patient simulators for reinforcement learning.
Chapter \ref{ch:simulators-sota} reviews the existing patient simulators and identifies major issues, particularly the fact they are based on dangerously small datasets.
Chapter \ref{ch:heartpole} introduces a simple and deliberately clinically inaccurate simulator to be used as a sanity check in part \ref{part:patientspirl}.
Chapter \ref{ch:auto-als} introduces Auto-ALS: an \emph{antropodidactic} emergency care simulator based on a training software package for junior healthcare professionals.
Chapter \ref{ch:imagym} introduces an obstetric sonography simulator to test the capabilities of PIRL systems in difficult high-dimensional environments.
Finally, chapter \ref{ch:mimicseq} makes the first step towards a big data driven patient simulator, proposing a sequential dataset for training foundation models in intensive care.

Part \ref{part:patientspirl} concludes the thesis: chapter \ref{ch:eval} implements a limited proof of concept PatientSPIRL system with program induction methodology proposed in chapter \ref{ch:seidr} and patient simulators proposed in chapters \ref{ch:heartpole} and \ref{ch:auto-als}.
Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} discusses the results and the implications thereof for the future of program synthesis in healthcare.
