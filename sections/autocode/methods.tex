Automatic program synthesis has been a long term goal of the field of artificial intelligence since its inception \cite{mannaAutomaticProgramSynthesis1971a}, promising to reduce the workload of software developers by automatically solving some of the tasks they face.

However, a fully autonomous system for Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning is yet to be devised. In chapter \ref{ch:bfpp}
