\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Automatic discovery of clinical strategies is a nascent field of research that has a potential to considerably improve patient outcomes and become a new modus operandi in healthcare research.
The goal of this paper is to provide a solid foundation for further development of this field with better patient simulators and better understanding thereof.
We have reviewed the state of the art in patient simulators, identified some of the problems the field is facing and proposed novel simulators to address them.
We believe that \emph{HeartPole} and \emph{Auto-ALS} can become new standard benchmarks for reinforcement learning in healthcare, while \emph{GraphSim} can become a stepping stone to improved patient outcomes in intensive care.
